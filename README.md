# In a Hurry
*by Jannes W.*

In **In a Hurry**, you have **60 seconds** to rob a bank!  

> ⚠️ Note: This is my **first project** using the Unity game engine, so it's not perfect yet. I hope you enjoy it!

## How to Install
1. Go to: [In a Hurry on itch.io](https://janneswendelken.itch.io/in-a-hurry)  
2. Download and extract the ZIP file.  
3. Open the `.exe` file to play the game.  

Enjoy it!
